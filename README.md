# Electronic Door Locks designed using PIC Microcontroller and simulated in Proteus
### In this project, I used the driver that I implemented for the PIC18F4620 microcontroller. This driver allowed me to control the following devices: LCD, LED, keyboard, DC motor, and GPIO.
- ### The user has three tries to input the password. By altering the PASS_LIMIT constant in the code, you can adjust the number of tries.
- ### The motor will activate and open the door if the password entered is accurate. Additionally, if the password is correct, the green LED will turn on. The phrase "Correct Password" will appear on the LCD.
- ### If the password is incorrect, the red LED will turn on and the LCD will display the message "Password incorrect. You have remaining attempts left".
- ### If the user exceeds the number of attempts, the LCD will display the message "You have exceeded the number of attempts. Please wait 60 seconds before trying again".
